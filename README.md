![My favorite thread involving my bot](favthread.png)

This is one of my favorite threads involving my bot. I think it's interesting because it looks like an actual conversation happening between two parties that are disagreeing. Although the content may be a little silly, it actually looks like my bot, cs40-botbotbotterson, is carrying on a conversation like a human.

## Score
I believe my score should be 20/20. I completed all the tasks, reached 100 comments, and created the repository which gets 16/20. I then did the extra credit tasks:


1. Have your bot upvote any comment mentioning your favorite candidate. (+1)

2. Have your bot upvote any submission mentioning your favorite candidate. (+1)

3. Have your bot post new submissions to the /r/csci040 subreddit. These submissions should be from the top submissions of a political subreddit that supports your favorite presidential candidate (e.g. /r/politics or /r/conservative). Your bot must post at least 20 of these submissions to receive the extra credit. (+2)
